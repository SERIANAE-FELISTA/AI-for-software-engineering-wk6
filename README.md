**Theoretical analysis**
**Explain how Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to cloud-based AI. Provide a real-world example.**
Edge AI refers to running AI models directly on local devices (edge devices) such as smartphones, IoT sensors, autonomous drones, or security cameras—rather than sending data to the cloud for processing.

**How Edge AI reduces latency**
Local processing: Because computations happen on the device itself, data does not need to travel over the internet to a remote server.
Faster response times: This eliminates network delays and results in near-instant decisions.
Ideal for real-time applications: Critical systems (e.g., drones, robots, self-driving cars) can make split-second decisions.

**Real-world example: Autonomous drones**
Autonomous drones use Edge AI to analyze camera feeds, detect obstacles, and navigate in real time. ie A drone surveying a disaster zone processes video on-board.
It avoids hazards instantly without needing to send video to the cloud.

**Compare Quantum AI and classical AI in solving optimization problems. What industries could benefit most from Quantum AI?**
Classical AI uses traditional computing and struggles with very large optimization problems.
Quantum AI uses qubits that can evaluate many possibilities simultaneously, making it far more powerful for complex optimization tasks.
**Industries that benefit most:**
Logistics, finance, pharmaceuticals, energy, manufacturing, and telecommunications — where large-scale optimization is crucial.
